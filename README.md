Here a short explanation on the folder structure and how every program works.

- **performance_analysis** contains a python script for the *Performance analysis* internship. 
Change the program name in the main function to the Java program that you want to analyse and run. This program then outputs the elapsed time and the peak memory usage of the program.

- **print_classes_and_methods** contains a Java program (with jar to test it out) that takes the name of a jar file as input and prints all the classes and its methods out to the standard output.
Example usage `java -jar program.jar <jar_to_analyse>`
This is my submission for the *Open source framework for application post-processing* internship.

- **print_contained_classes** contains a Java program (with jar to test it out) that is very similar to `print_classes_and_methods` and also takes the name of a jar file as input to print out all the contained classes to the standard output. 
Example usage `java -jar program.jar <jar_to_analyse>`
This is my submission for the *Detection of outdated libraries* internship.

- **random_android_packages** contains a python script that generates 100 random package names that are valid conform the Android naming convention. 
This is my submission for the *Large scale analysis* internship.
